Searching is the process of finding a specific from a collection of elements

Linear search: This is the simplest searching algorithm.
It checks each element in the list or array sequentially
until it finds the target element or reaches the end.

Binary search: Binary search is an efficient searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays or lists.
It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
If the value of the target is less than the value in the middle,
the search continues in the left half, otherwise, it continues in the right half.

Sorting is the process of arranging elements in specific order

1. Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements,
and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

2. Selection Sort
Selection Sort divides the list into a sorted and unsorted part.
It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves
it to the sorted part.

3. Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one item at a time.
It picks an element from the unsorted part and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted part.

4. Merge Sort (Divide and Conquer)
Merge Sort divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges them back together.

5. Quick Sort (Divide and Conquer)
Quick Sort picks a pivot element, partitions the array such that
elements smaller than the pivot go to the left,and larger elements to the right.
It then recursively sorts the subarrays.
